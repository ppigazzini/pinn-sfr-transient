# Axial PINN — formulation, recipe, and measured results

The neural-network side of the 1D axial boiling model. The physics, and every
deviation from the SAS4A/SASSYS-1 manual, are in
[`axial_physics.md`](axial_physics.md); this document covers the ansatz, the
training recipe, the two backends, and **what has actually been measured** —
including the results that came out badly, which are most of them.

> **Status.** The network trains, satisfies every hard constraint exactly, and
> reproduces the reference to **3–12% relative `L2`** against an acceptance bar of
> 1%. It does **not** meet that bar. Section 6 documents a bug hunt that found the
> bar itself is partly unsound, and section 5 documents five standard remedies
> that all made the fit *worse*. None of this is presented as a working result.

## 1. What the network solves

A map `(ζ, t) → (T_f, T_cl, T_s, T_c, α)`, trained on the Chapter 3 residuals
alone. No reference data enters the loss; the reference is used only at test time,
the protocol the 0D model already follows ([`neural_network.md`](neural_network.md) §7).

**One set of equations.** The residual calls
`axial.physics.continuous_derivatives` — the same function, and therefore the same
flux and boiling expressions, that the M2 reference solver discretises. A test
rebuilds the residual by hand from it and asserts bit-equality, so the network and
its ground truth cannot drift apart. This is the axial counterpart of the 0D
model's `tests/test_consistency.py`.

Two modes:

| | power | collocation |
|---|---|---|
| **Plan B** (M3) | prescribed, `P(t)/P_0 = 1` | scattered `(ζ, t̂)` |
| **Plan A** (M6) | an **output** of the prompt-jump closure | time only, against the fixed axial quadrature |

Plan A has to use a tensor grid because reactivity is an axial *integral*
(Eq. 4.5-3, Eq. 4.5-25): one power amplitude couples every node at a given time to
every other, and an integral cannot be evaluated on a random cloud of points.
Field residuals are then reduced over that quadrature so all six blocks are one
value per time — which is also the shape causal weighting wants. RAR is disabled
under feedback, since it adds arbitrary points and a quadrature rule cannot absorb
them.

## 2. The ansatz — every constraint hard, none in the loss

```math
\theta_k(\zeta, \hat t) = \theta_{k,0}(\zeta)\,\exp\!\big(\hat t\, N_k(\zeta, \hat t)\big),
\qquad
\alpha = \tanh(a\hat t)\,\tanh(a\zeta)\,\sigma(N_\alpha),
\qquad
c_i = \exp\!\big(\hat t\, N_{c,i}(\hat t)\big)
```

| Constraint | Mechanism | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Initial condition | `exp(0) = 1` | exact, `0.0` |
| **Positivity `T ≥ T_in`** | `θ₀ ≥ 0` times a positive exponential | exact under ×50 adversarial weights |
| Coolant inlet `T_c(0,t) = T_in` | `θ_c0(0) = 0`, so it falls out of the same form | exact, `0.0`, **no separate gate** |
| Void `α ∈ [0,1)`, void-free start, none at inlet | gated sigmoid | exact by construction |
| Precursors `c(0) = 1`, `c > 0` | bounded exponential | exact |

Nothing is penalised, so the objective is pure physics and there is one fewer
competing term for the weighting to balance.

**The multiplicative form replaced an additive one, and that was a formulation fix,
not a refactor.** With `θ = θ₀ + t̂·N` nothing bounded the temperatures below.
Logging `min(T_f)` through training shows the optimiser walking

```
722 K  →  441 K  →  170 K  →  −1 K      over 115 iterations, while the loss FELL
```

after which `log(T_f/T_f0)` in the logarithmic Doppler (Eq. 4.5-3) returns NaN and
Plan A dies. The residual was perfectly content in that region: the
spurious-solution failure mode of
[arXiv:2604.23528](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.23528), and exactly what REPORT-01
§5.2 item 8 says to parameterise away — advice this model had applied to the void
and precursors but not to the temperatures. Constraining the ansatz to the
physical manifold removes the region rather than penalising it.

The exponent is bounded, `exp(S·tanh(x/S))` with `S = 4`, so it cannot overflow;
the reference needs at most a 9.6× growth in excess temperature against the `e⁴ ≈ 55×`
allowed, so the ceiling never binds and `tanh` stays in its linear region.

**Admissibility, checked before adopting**: `θ₀ ≥ 0` for all four fields, zero only
at `ζ = 0` for the coolant and structure — exactly where the boundary condition
pins them. The structure being pinned to `T_in` at the inlet is correct, not a
side effect: its only coupling is to the coolant, held at `T_in` there.

## 3. Training recipe

Adam with cosine decay → L-BFGS polish, plus causal temporal weighting
[Wang, Sankaran & Perdikaris 2024], gradient-norm adaptive block weights
[Wang, Teng & Perdikaris 2021], and residual-adaptive refinement
[Wu et al. 2023]. float64 throughout. Init is `U(±1/√fan_in)` on weights *and*
biases in both backends — [`neural_network.md`](neural_network.md) §9 records what
happens when the two disagree.

Available and **off by default**, because the ablation in §5 says they hurt:
time-window curriculum (`n_windows`), random Fourier features
(`fourier_features`), the two-encoder modified MLP (`modified_mlp`), and
pseudo-time stepping (`pts_every`).

## 4. Two backends, and why

`pinn_torch.py` is object-oriented and eager; `pinn_jax.py` is functional
(Equinox + Optax). They share the residual functions and differ only in training
mechanics. That is the point: a disagreement between them is informative.

It has already paid twice. It showed the pre-fix failure was **not**
backend-specific, so the formulation was implicated rather than PyTorch. Then,
after the positivity fix, torch improved 2.5–8.7× and JAX did not move at all —
which exposed a real bug in the JAX port: it trained on a frozen collocation set
between RAR refreshes, where the 0D twin (and torch) resample every step. Fixing
that did **not** close the accuracy gap, so the gap remains open.

## 5. Measured results

All at **3000 Adam + 300 L-BFGS**, seed 0, relative `L2` against the reference,
unless stated. The acceptance bar is `1e-2`.

### 5.1 The positivity fix

| | T_f | T_cl | T_s | T_c |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| additive ansatz | 0.156 | 0.374 | 0.278 | 0.177 |
| **multiplicative** | **0.062** | **0.120** | **0.032** | **0.034** |

2.5–8.7× better, and Plan A stopped producing NaN. This is the only change that
has ever produced a directional improvement, and it came from tracing an actual
failure rather than applying a recipe.

### 5.2 Seed robustness (additive ansatz, five seeds)

`T_f` 0.14–0.21, `T_cl` 0.19–0.37, `T_s` 0.07–0.28, `T_c` 0.03–0.23. No lucky
seed; the failure was systematic, not variance.

### 5.3 Budget — **non-monotonic**

| Adam iters | T_f | T_cl | T_s | T_c |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3000 | **0.062** | 0.120 | **0.032** | 0.034 |
| 8000 | 0.246 | 0.095 | 0.075 | 0.028 |

`T_f` gets **4× worse** with more training. Non-monotonic in budget means the
optimiser wanders between minima rather than converging slowly, so more iterations
will not fix this.

### 5.4 Remedy ablation — **every one made it worse**

Worst relative `L2` across the four temperature fields:

| configuration | worst |
|---|---|
| **baseline** | **0.120** |
| time windows = 5 | 0.188 |
| time windows = 10 | 0.201 |
| Fourier features = 32 | 0.255 |
| modified MLP | 0.397 |

The modified MLP — jaxpi's default architecture — is **3.3× worse** here than a
plain MLP. Five techniques that are standard for this class of problem all degrade
it. That is itself the result: when the accepted remedies for "the PINN will not
converge" consistently hurt, the problem is not the training recipe, and stacking
published methods on top is noise around whatever is actually wrong.

### 5.5 Per-equation residual scaling — a provable no-op

The blocks' time constants are 0.58 s (fuel), 0.025 s (cladding), 0.107 s
(structure), 0.113 s (coolant transit) against a 60 s horizon, so scaling all four
by `t_end` leaves `t_end/τ` spanning 104 to 2378. Rescaling each block by its own
time constant — the standard advice for stiff multiscale PINNs — reproduced the
previous result **to every digit**. Two structural reasons: Adam is scale-invariant,
and the gradient-norm weighting sets `λ_k = mean(g)/g_k`, cancelling any fixed
per-block constant exactly. `physics.residual_scales` keeps the numbers as a
diagnostic and is deliberately not wired into the residual.

## 6. Bug hunt — what is actually wrong

### 6.1 The ansatz can represent the solution

Fitted to the reference by supervised regression (no physics): **rel `L2` ≈ 2.3e-3
on all four fields.** So architecture, width, depth and hard constraints are all
adequate, and the entire "try a better architecture" family of remedies is ruled
out — consistent with §5.4.

### 6.2 A measurement artefact, corrected

Evaluating the physics residual at that fit gave 1e8–1e9 for `T_f` and `T_cl`,
which looked like proof that the true solution is not a minimum of the loss. It was
not: those were **interpolation errors of the fit**, measured at random points while
the fit was only enforced on the reference grid. On the grid the same residuals are
3.2 and 2.2e3. Recorded because the first number was reported before the control
was run, which was the wrong order.

### 6.3 The void residual is real, and localised

On the reference grid, mean squared residual by time:

| | t ∈ [0,8) | t ∈ [8,14) | t ∈ [14,60) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **alpha** | **6.87** | **2.95e5** | **4.84e5** |
| T_c | 931 | 4.51e3 | 1.42e4 |
| T_cl | 494 | 2.10e3 | 6.76e3 |

Five orders of magnitude across boiling onset, and not an artefact — present at the
grid points themselves.

### 6.4 The reference is not converged in `α`

| reference `n = 40` vs `n = 320` | T_f | T_cl | T_c | **alpha** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| relative `L2` | 5.1e-3 | 7.2e-3 | 5.4e-3 | **1.03e-1** |

**The reference the PINN has been scored against is itself ~10% wrong in the void
fraction**, because it is first-order upwind at `n_axial = 40` and the front spans
2–6 cells. The temperatures are converged to ~5e-3 — which sits right at the 1e-2
acceptance bar, leaving almost no headroom.

Two consequences:

* `L_void_max_err_m = 0.391 m`, a number that did not move across *any*
  configuration tried, was never the PINN's error to fix.
* The M2 convergence study measured orders on the **non-boiling** case, so the void
  field's non-convergence went unmeasured. That is a gap in the test design, not in
  the solver: everything `axial_physics.md` §5 claims about the reference — exact
  steady state, energy conservation, convergence orders — was verified and stands.

## 7. What to do next

In order, and none of it is "add another method":

1. **Fix the measurement first.** Score against `n_axial ≥ 160`, and re-derive the
   acceptance bar so it sits above the reference's own error. Some unknown part of
   the "PINN failure" is the ruler.
2. **Score `α` on a metric a front can satisfy** — voided length, onset time and
   location — rather than a pointwise norm across an unconverged discontinuity.
3. **Only then** re-run the ablation. Remedies aimed at a moving front cannot be
   judged against a reference that resolves the front to 10%.

Until (1) and (2) are done, no accuracy number from this model should be quoted,
and none is quoted in this repository outside this document.
